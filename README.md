# Flutter project

Creating a flutter app to integrate with an IOT device.


## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### The prototype of the flutter project is given in file prototype.pdf in code base, clone the repository to add any features to the app


# Product Description:
 A Home Automation System where the device can be fit into any kind of switch board that is already exixting with the wall, so need of additional changes to the boad.

 It is compact, it can easily fit inside the switch
board box.

 The device can be used in Manual existing switch and with
internet (app).

 Adding on, it can be also used with Voice Control like Alexa and
Google Assistance.

## FEATURES NEEDED FOR THE PROJECT(APP):
The device comes with two Wi-Fi modules i.e. NodeMCU and
ESP-01. So, the firmware should be compatible with the both
modules.
## 1. NODE-MCU MODULE:
 With this module we have to control up to three devices.

 But in the Node-MCU Module we have to use SIX GPIO output
pins

 So, the code should be like three output pins must go to three
Relays and the other three output pin must go to the manual
switch.

 In the homepage of app interface, there should be horizontal
tab like All Devices, Living Room, Bed room, Second Bedroom,
Dining Room, Kitchen, Study room and others (others name can
be edit).

 Each tab has its own Add or (+) Button to add the devices or we
can add it from special + button on the top right corner of the
app interface.

 The app should be compatible with multiple Home automation
systems at one place.

 The app should also have the live feedback i.e. when we switch
off the device with manual switch then it should send the
feedback to the app showing the device is off and vice versa.

 The app also needs add schedule time for the devices.

 There should be a QR code for each device so we can scan and
add in the app easily.

 Like when we plug the device on, then scan the QR code enter
the WIFI credentials and add to the respective tab and done.

 Finally, each app has its own login option so that one device
can be operated by all the family members with the same
unique login credentials.

## 2. ESP-01 MODULE:
 With this module we have to control up to two devices.

 But in the ESP-01 Module we have four GPIO output pins

 So, the code should be like two output pins must go to two
Relays and the other two output pin must go to the manual
switch.

 In the homepage of app interface, there should be horizontal
tab like All Devices, Living Room, Bed room, Second Bedroom,
Dining Room, Kitchen, Study room and others (others name can
be edit)

 Each tab has its own Add or (+) Button to add the devices or we
can add it from special + button on the top right corner of the
app interface.

 The app should be compatible with multiple Home automation
systems at one place.

 The app should also have the live feedback i.e. when we switch
off the device with manual switch then it should send the
feedback to the app showing the device is off and vice versa.

 The app also needs add schedule time for the devices.

 There should be a QR code for each device so we can scan and
add in the app easily.

 Like when we plug the device on, then scan the QR code enter
the WIFI credentials and add to the respective tab and done.

 Finally, each app has its own login option so that one device
can be operated by all the family members with the same
unique login credentials.
